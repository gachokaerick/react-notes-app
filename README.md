This is a simple app that uses React Js basics to create a note-creation app.
The notes are draggable and have 2 display modes:
    1. The view mode - for simply viewing the note without editing
    2.The edit mode - for editing the note and saving the changes
The notes are displayed randomly on the screen upon creation.
In edit mode, the notes are automatically selected and ready
to copy or replace with ease.
